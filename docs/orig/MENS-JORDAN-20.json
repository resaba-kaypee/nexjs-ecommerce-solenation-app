            "story": "\"The Trophy Room x Air Jordan 1 High “Chicago” is a desirable collaboration between Marcus Jordan’s sneaker boutique and Jordan Brand on Michael Jordan’s first signature shoe. This version of Trophy Room's \"\"Freeze Out\"\" colorway includes alternate blue laces that were packaged only with friends and family pairs gifted by Trophy Room. Pairs sold via Nike SNKRS and elsewhere did not include blue laces. The colorway suggests that Michael was indeed \"\"frozen out\"\" of the 1985 NBA All-Star Game by his future Basketball Hall of Fame teammates. Several subtle nods to the “freeze out” appear on the shoe, beginning with the icy texture covering the red leather overlays found on the forefoot, eyelets, collar, and heel. Elsewhere, white leather appears on the perforated toe and on the mid-panel. Black shoelaces sit atop the white nylon tongue that features a red nylon tongue tag with “Nike Air” branding. A black leather Swoosh is located on either side and a black “Wings” emblem can be found on the collar. Michael Jordan’s signature is printed onto the heel above the sail midsole. The translucent blue outsole dons blue and red stars to finish off the look. Release date: February 10, 2021.\"",

A hockey mask and an \"\"E\"\" graphic replace the Air Jordan 4's original \"\"Nike Air\"\" branding on the back of the left and right shoe, respectively. Chrome accents, a cloudy clear grey outsole, and a leather inner lining finish off the look. Only 10 pairs of the Eminem x Carhartt x Air Jordan 4 were released on eBay in 2015, with proceeds benefiting the Literacy Through Songwriting program. Please note: this item comes in a damaged shoe box.\"",

            "story": "\"Jordan Brand drops another sneaker themed after MJ’s short stint playing minor league baseball: the Air Jordan 9 \"\"Baseball Glove.\"\" The age-old tradition of opening baseball trading cards inspires the mystery packaging, as the Nike Air Jordan 9 box contains a blind-bag (each individually numbered) that contains one of the two Jordan 9 colorways. Consumers won’t know if they’ve purchased the black or brown leather version until the bag is opened post-purchase. Traditional baseball glove construction inspires the use of tumbled leather and woven side panels that mimic the webbing. Number \"\"45\"\" (Birmingham Barons) or \"\"35\"\" (Scottsdale Scorpions) stitching appear on the heel of the black and brown pairs, respectively. An enlarged Pinnacle hangtag completes the design.\"",
