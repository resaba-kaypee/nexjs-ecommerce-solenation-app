Wasted Youth, which precedes the Japanese designer’s Girls Don’t Cry streetwear imprint, was revived for this limited edition colorway of the SB Dunk Low and, true to its nickname, the look is wholly influenced by the rebellious spirit of punk rock. The upper’s washed black denim base features a decidedly pre-worn look with fraying and unfinished edges on each panel. A frayed black tumbled leather Swoosh logo appears on the lateral side and an embroidered red rose motif is incorporated into the design of the Swoosh branding on the medial side. Red contrast stitching can be found on the back of the shoe beneath the silver metallic hoops that are hooked into the leather branding patch on the heel. The slogans “Wasted” and Youth” are embroidered on the back of the left and right shoe, respectively. Verdy and Nike SB add a patchwork-like leather and denim overlay to the forefoot of each shoe. Mismatched white and black Nike SB branding can be found on the right and left tongue tags. Note: This listing is for pairs that include the special limited edition shoe box.

This is the listing for the special packaging version of the “Turdunken” SB Dunk that was released exclusively at Concepts. Described by Deon Point, Concepts’ Creative Director, as the “most off-the-wall thing we’ve ever done,” the “Turdunken” is inspired by the popular Holiday dish of stuffing both a chicken and duck inside of a turkey. The design is based on the mallard duck. Overtures to the waterfowl include an iridescent blue and green Swoosh on either side and leather textured to look like feathers on the mid-panel. Suede detailing on the heel mimics duck down. Additional tongue-in-cheek nods to the mallard duck include an orange sole in reference to its legs and feet and a toile print on the insole and collar lining displaying a flock of mallards (and even a lobster or two, as well.)

A translucent midfoot strap with Egyptian symbols laid within the shell contrasts the icy hues of the “seeing eye” heel design and blue-based midsole.
